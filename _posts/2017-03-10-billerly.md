At the turn of the year I launched [Billerly](https://billerly.com){:target='blank'}. I haven't done much with it since then by ways of updates or upgrades.

This will be an experiment in having an extremely passive service running in the background with minimal marketting other than the occasional blog post here, as well as the usual FB Ads / Google AdWords impressions. I don't have any active involvement in this and don't plan to for the foreseeable future.

Hopefully I'll have some interesting posts while I learn how to passively market a service to profitability, right now costs are basically non-existant with SSL and server power on Heroku.

Stay tuned.
