I have often thought about starting a "blog". 

When I have solved (what I thought to be) a complex problem in software with an elegant solution, I currently have nowhere to dump it for future reference. 

Even, on occasion, have I wanted to elaborate on a topic but lack the correct audience right there and then.

This will be where those sorts of things will go. Expect almost everything to be related to programming or personal projects.
